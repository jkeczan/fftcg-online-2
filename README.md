## Setting up the Dev Environment
1. Make sure you have Node installed (14.19.1) only. On Linux/Mac, HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). This will save your life and keep you from getting gray hair. If you are on windows, consider running a VM of Linux.
2. Run the following commands to install the toolchain ```npm install -g @angular/cli``` and ```npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli```
2. Clone this repo and the sister repo [FFTCG Online Game Server](https://github.com/jkeczan/fftcg-online-2)
3. Once cloned, run ```npm install``` for both projects

5. For the game server, run ```npm run start```
